# MALARIA-DISEASE-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
 I did this project using ML and Neural Networks ,. Classification Algorithms like  KNN, Decision Tree ,Logistic Regression, SVC,Random Forest,Naive Bayes ,XG boost are  used my model can predict whether the new patient has severe malaria or not. Several  Vectorization techniques are used to convert verbal text into Mathematical form.
